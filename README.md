## What we used?
_Technologies used_: Flask, Flask-babel, html, css, js

## What we do?
It is a web application with frontend and backend. The main task of the application is informational.
The site contains information about the biker club, a photo from the event, a video presentation and 
a map with the location of the headquarters.
The web application has 2 languages - English and Ukrainian. Depending on the data that comes from the user's browser, 
the server determines the user's preferred language.

## How to start project?
1. Run `git clone {SSH-link from GitHub}` on your PC;
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`;
3. Create '.flaskenv' file and write to it environment variables:
	- SECRET_KEY (Fot example: '*jfjn&nf8jfghg=fgkhd6k56566');
	- DEBUG=1 (for development). Not used for deploy;
    - FLASK_APP=runner.py;
4. Run `pybabel compile -d app/translations` The command will create a configuration file with translations for the site;
5. Run `python3 runner.py` ;

<h6>If information has been added to the site that needs to be translated, the following instructions will help you.</h6>
If we want to scan files, restore the layout in the file, to translate the text, this is done using the command
inside the root folder of our environment:
`pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .`<br>
This generates the messages.pot file which can be recompiled every time we need to update our translations and therefore 
also should be excluded from versioning.
Now we want to create our translation files where we manually need to translate all the text we extracted from our files. 
These files will be created inside the app/translations folder and are generated with the following command:
`pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l uk`<br>
This creates the file for the Ukraine translation. Our next task is to go to app/translations , open the *.po files and 
translate all the text in the respective language.
Once this tedious work is over with, we can compile all of our translations with the command:
`pybabel compile -d app/translations`<br>
